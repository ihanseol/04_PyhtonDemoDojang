tommy here from lauren systems and we're
going to talk about synology
versus true nas and i've been wanting to
do this video but it's
not easy to articulate because it's not
an easy decision because it's not like
one or the other one has advantages over
the other we're going to talk about that
but it's not like there's an easy you
know all this way or all that way
it depends i know that's the part people
hate the answer they want just a
definitive answer tell me what to buy
what i want to do is go over the
scenarios
and the solution you're looking for and
help that steer you into what may
make you happy and what may be the right
fit for
you and of course because we sell both
these products and we deploy both of
these products
we're going to talk about our decision
making process that leads to that

so check back frequently
and finally our forums
forums.laurensystems.com is where you
can have a more in-depth discussion
about this video and other tech topics
you've seen on this channel
now back to our content now don't make
the assumption that because i stuck the
synology on top of the freenas that i
think it stacks up better just so
happens the feet fit exactly this size
but the opposite isn't true
so if you were to buy both of these this
fits on top um
not ideal though it's not stable anyways
this is the synology ds1520 plus and
this is a freenas
or trueness core i mini ix plus now both
of these were sent to me by the
respective companies for review
ix system sent me this and of course
analogy sent me this
and i have them both turned on and
running because the first thing i want
to talk about is are they quiet
that's one of those debates that come up
a lot and synology's done a great job
across their product line of making
relatively quiet products that are in
this form factor
and i did review this analogy rack mount
stuff it's a little bit louder but rack
mount stuff generally noise is
less of a concern we want it to be
quieter but we also want it to be cool
and it's going to be running a long time
in a rack so
the fans usually you know push a little
more air create a little bit of noise
these are designed possibly to sit next
to you and with
free nas truenast because you can build
your own or
get a turnkey product uh the one that
they make these
mini series which i really like uh offer
turnkey and quiet solutions
and like i said the disk station series
these smaller ones like this are also
quiet
and it's a kind of across their product
line now
the nice thing about true nas though is
because you can build it yourself and
that would be a very distinct difference
between synology
i'm not going to address x penology
it is essentially a kind of a fork but
it's not officially supported it's 100
community supported
great if you're a home user and want to
tinker with it uh so you can build on
your own hardware we're going to stick
specifically with the supported dsm
because i'm assuming
a little bit more maybe small business
and other use cases homeland people well
that's just having fun and not something
i would you know deploy commercially
so i'm not going to address that and
we're going to keep this focused on
synology
and surenames because they're both
solutions we deploy they're both
solutions we use
and i think that's a very important
aspect to think about
because a lot of people just regurgitate
information off of spec sheets
i'm going to talk about real world
deployments i have not used many of the
other ones out there so if you have your
favorite nas system which seems to come
up all the time hey tom please review
this well i don't use it unless i
actually plan to deploy it
i'm not as likely to do a review on it
so my experience is a lot of what this
is going to be
calling from we've sold a lot of the ix
systems
and we've done everything from the
high-end enterprise as in
50 50 000 plus servers
with high availability that we have sold
to large companies in the enterprise
market you know of course
you've seen some of the reviews if
you've spent some time in this channel
but you can find them for the true nas
you know built purpose-built hardware
for the enterprise which is awesome but
this is the same software you can
download and build yourself a small nas
box or
if you're going i don't feel like
building something i want something that
i know works that's
what trueness mini ix sells is this
right here now same with synology we've
put
a lot of these in small businesses we've
used a lot of them for the surveillance
station we've had these out in the field
for a while we've been
selling deploying using so all of my
experience on both of these
is at different levels of usage and of
course
internally we use freenas for well this
video is being edited on a freenas
server so
i have a lot of experience using these
so that's where my review is going to
come from
now let's break down the comparison i'll
leave a link
to this google sheet i put together but
this is a
one-to-one kind of objective comparison
i wanted to start there there's always a
subjective i just like something better
and i try to keep that bias out at least
here in the beginning there is of course
some importance to that bias because
maybe you
like how much easier it is to set up
something but even
easy to set up is a real subjective easy
to you but maybe not easy someone else
so let's start right here
and start with the file system i think
this is really important when you talk
about nash you're talking about the
security
and integrity of your files and
synology's taking the approach of
building it on the mdm
raid system because it's a linux based
system with butter fs
now there's some contention you'll find
if you read about butterfs handling hard
drives and some issues this is why it's
analogies went with mdadem raid
butter fs and ext4 so they have a
combination of things that they can do
to take advantage of
and keep it efficient and keep it good
they also have bitrate protection et
cetera et cetera
so they've put this together and it's
you know we
find it very stable haven't really had
problems with their file system or
losses on there but nasa is not a backup
just because you have a bunch of drives
you should always be backing this up
and that's even true with zfs but zfs is
next level
and i've heard it referred to many times
as the billion dollar file system
that is because of the amount of time
research and development over the years
that has gone into
zfs and it is an outstanding file system
for
absolutely massive scalable storage so
zfs hands down one of the you know
really advanced file systems out there
when it comes to what they refer to as
copy on right now butter fs bt
rfs is misspelled right here but also
copy on right so that is
also a feature of it but zfs much more
advanced
does it really really well and also with
the upcoming trunas 12 release they've
added features
such as the fusion pools and it's a
really interesting
enhancement that they've brought to the
table with
zfs so it's it's a lot of power in zfs
and i can't say enough good things about
it and it's one of the reasons it's so
popular
and a lot of people sing praises about
it now
open source is a big factor so if you're
into
the open source ecosystem like i am and
essentially an open source enthusiast
like i refer to myself
i'm even though synology's built on
linux is not a fully open source system
and this is common a lot of companies
use the linux space and add some of
their own code to it so you don't you
can't just go grab the synology with the
exception of what i said about
exponology but that's still a fork and
not
fully supported et cetera but yeah it's
not fully open source
truenas core on the other hand fully
open source and this is why true nasa
and ix systems say
well freenas and junas are the largest
open source project when it comes to
storage
because they aren't kind of sorta open
source they are
open source and it's fully open source
with bsd based with your nas and i will
mention because i've done a video on it
but it's
you know future release is going to be
true in a scale which is going to be
linux based
still all the great zfs features but a
lot of people you know really like the
options you may get and enhancements
that may come with a linux based system
so true nascale
same thing open source and going to be
based on linux but we're going to talk
today about truenast core because it's
available today
on these systems even though it's in
beta depending on when you're watching
this what level of beta
and that's going to be all bsd based
expandable raid now this is one of those
yes but type answers so yes for models
that support satur synology hybrid rate
so you can grab your pile of drives and
throw them in there and have
expansion going on and it will any
intelligent way handle it
you can expand true nas but the v-dubs
have to match
so i've got a separate video where i get
more in depth than that so
no you can't just grab random drives
there is a methodology where you have to
pair up the v-dubs in a similar way they
don't have to be exactly the same drives
they can be different
sizes but the pools themselves have to
be
containing the v devs and it'll get
complicated if i keep going on so i'll
leave a link to that video
so yes but is the answer on there which
is you know
i think it's important and if you want
something that is a little bit easier
we'll
it sees from a back to that subjective
versus objective
yeah we're going to say it's just easier
to do it in synology
but part of the thing with zfs is a
little bit more rigid
and the way it works but that's also
what gives it some of that resilience it
has for
protecting your data plugins synology
and community supported
uh ix systems and community so we do
have um the systology based plugins on
there
and that comes down to if you have a
plugin that is
really specific to what you're looking
for um and it's only available on one of
these platforms
that may be one of those deciding
factors that you've made your decision
on
and we'll get to that a little bit more
at the bottom but that is obviously
a factor but the fact is you have a lot
of flexibility with both of these
because you can
run some other things on them especially
if it has docker support which we'll
talk about later
virtual machine storage support as a
target so nfs nice because the error is
supported on both of these
so you can configure that and set that
up snapshot replication
yes via butter fs and yes via zfs now
this is a feature of both of these file
systems where you can create you know
essentially snapshots to protect
yourself against uh
maybe something that catastrophically
destroys data because you have a share
and
you know ransomware being popular here
in 2020 if something happens you can
just roll back to that snapshot or
because you want to replicate it now
snapshots create points in time that
which you can replicate at essentially a
block level
zfs replication i've done videos on this
extremely powerful extremely fast
and it's based off of those snapshots
that can be replicated to duplicate your
data somewhere else and that feature
based on butterfest is available in
synology s3 target support
maybe not everyone's looking for this
but i think it's interesting that it's
natively built into the juneau system
which essentially means it can act as an
s3 server i did a little searching i
didn't find
natively a way to do it on synology i
did find people who had write-ups on
doing it but i didn't see native support
for s3 it's kind of an edge case it may
not be a deciding factor but at least
i'll mention it that it's built in there
rsync now they both support rsync i
find the rsync in synology to be a
little bit trickier to use
and i say that because it was easy to
take two synologies and have them rsync
to each other that part
really simple uh having it talk to other
devices less simple
two nas core implements standard rsync
so whether you're pushing or pulling
data from rsync or want to set up an
rsync port
or our sync over ssh they just made it
really simple to do
in uh the true nas system freenas system
however you want to look at it it's been
in there for a long time and it's
standard space
rsync over standard ports and also
standard ways to do it so
i've used this quite a bit on trueness
when we have people who want to
synchronize with
different devices as well as those other
devices whether they be
a standalone device or another nas as
long as standards
implemented our sync support is there in
neither the nas or of course easy from
the command line
no problem syncing with this and a lot
of people have a lot of custom solutions
based on rsync so having that just as a
built-in support is really nice to the
web interface containerization uh
docker is on supported models of
synology
sureness core uses bsd and io cage jails
now
when truenas scale comes out that's
going to be docker-based once again
that's a future release but hey it's
something that is out there that's
available
so i thought i'd mentioned that you know
in the future that'll be something else
and i also bring up trueness scale every
now and then because it runs essentially
on the same hardware so if you ever
wanted to switch between them
your zfs pools should import finding be
able to switch between them but you're
if you have built things on
containerization because it's a
different platform well you'll have to
rebuild all your plugins
windows file sharing seems obvious but
yes they fully support it
manage users and permissions through the
interface yes there's a user manager in
both of these so
i'm not talking about active directory
business generally installing this and
saying let's add some users let's build
some permissions
they both have acl access control list
management so you can assign users and
permissions
all that is fully supported on both of
these devices so if you just want to use
a windows
file server or a windows network it
works and if you're in a small business
office and you go hey i like active
directory integration
yes we have that in both devices where
we can tie tack to directory so active
directory
can just understand this device and can
control the permissions on it
80 server replacement now while this is
supported in synology
it's not like a drop in automatically
every feature in ad is there but it does
have basic 80 support so it can kind of
act as an
active directory server inside your
network that is not a feature
currently supported in sure nas i don't
know if it'll come in there or not
but i've always had mixed feelings about
this because it's
not full 80 and sometimes you can have
some quirkiness with it but for
you know small office or a home user
probably will work fine
it all depends on what use cases you
have for it surveillance software
is something i've talked a lot about
with synology we have cerney
surveillance station
requires licenses and
you get the first two for free or if you
buy the nvm models they come with a
couple more but i've done whole videos
on this i really like it
people ask me a lot about doing this on
truenast there's a community supported
plug-in i don't feel it's very well
developed it's not something i've ever
used in the enterprise i've looked at it
it seems
well i can only say kind of basic and
not well developed that's the only way i
can really describe that
it's not something that i would say is
turnkey oh yeah it's an awesome drop in
replacement
they have it it's there so i'm not going
to dwell on that much it's not something
i would recom
i've used or recommended for business
backup software
active backup is really cool i got to
admit that's a great synology supported
tool i've done videos on how this
integrates for backing up
windows computers windows servers how it
can back up things like office 365 and g
suite
there's like a whole suite of software
supported by synology that comes with
these devices
and it doesn't have any licenses with it
it's part of when you buy synologies
that support the active backup
back to it has to be a device that
supports it um as of right now
it seems like a lot of them do but once
again when you're choosing your nas
that's something you think about
community and third party support yes
there's actually a lot of different
plugins you can get and some of our
community or third party plugins that
are
on there that may have other advanced
features but there's nothing native
supported by ax systems it's like an
automatic turnkey
management tool that's like active
backup so if you came here looking for
active backup and that's what you want
and these are all those times when we're
going to go back to why we deploy
synology
that active backup is a big one now back
to that open source
conversation now because you know we
just because we chose these ix systems
mini x plus is because what i have but i
can really load
free and astronauts anywhere i want i
can grab the code i can do it if i have
systems decided
seems unlikely to stop releasing the
code or anything like that
someone would just fork it move on
matter of fact there are forks already
of that particular software
and deviations but i don't see that ever
changing it's 100
your software open source that you do
what you want with and that's a big
factor i really like
synology the device talks to synology
to get all the plugins to get the
software set up
if synology says you know what i don't
want to support it like i said i'm not
saying this is likely
but this is a factor if snalogy says
we're going to expire and
uh stop supporting and stop having
updates for these models
that's their choice to do so and that's
it that's where the support will end
if they decide to drop something out of
their plugins
and the way they get deliver them
through their system and locked in then
that's
it that's synology's choice to do so
because some of this is closed source
there's not any easy ways to update this
not that it's a real likely factor but
it's something that may play into it
doesn't stop us from deploying these
because it just you know technology
makes a good product especially when
you're using things like the office 365
backup
if that's one of the solutions this one
the times you're going to deploy it if
they want that active backup of
small office contacts us and say hey we
need something to
back up our workstations we don't want
to buy some other type of service
well then this is something that they're
absolutely going to
love where they can drop this in it's
pretty turnkey it gives you a nice
management
web interface and a lot of internal i.t
departments do like these technologies
they can set a couple of these up and
have
easy local backups now cloud backups are
awesome and both of these do support
once you get the data here
putting it in the cloud synology goes a
step further and offers some of their
own storage solutions
and you know kind of a nice feature they
do that versus
and they have not locking because you
can use other ones but you know it's a
nice turnkey system
and versus ix system still really nice
we use backblaze to back these up and
that's
our solution that works now let's talk a
little bit about the interfaces
the synology dsm interface very much has
a desktop ui
look and feel with the control panel and
just these simple things oh look here's
my users i can create
and uh click this little button at the
top here there's my
iscsi manager i can go to
file station we can look at shares we
have uh package center
and we can load things like plex and all
these different plugins they have
nice plugins a lot of support a lot of
different stuff that's supported in here
i really like the
extensiveness of the plug-ins the
ease of use so to speak of just pulling
them in there and away you go now you
still have to do some mapping and
drop some permissions in there and
connect your plex server to wherever
your storage is
and i you know i gotta admit i really
like this interface it's pretty
intuitive easy to use
this though is something i feel very at
home in as well and this is where things
get more subjective
i like the interface a lot for trueness
i find it
very robust it gives me deep levels of
access to tuning and setting things up
so when you talk about something like
iscsi you have some advanced options in
here
but you get a lot of very fine tuning
options
that may be very daunting and this may
be the first problem you have going this
is a bit much this is
not my space i want something very
simple and turnkey
synology goes a little bit more on the
simple side freenas i think it's
relatively
easy to use especially you know after
you take a little time and i've done
plenty of tutorials on this
um but yeah it's going to be a little
bit more complex they do have plug-in
support here
so you can still look up plug-ins from
ix systems or community they haven't
broke down here you can click the
install
we have plex server already loaded on
here just as a quick test to test
something on here
and not a problem to install but it's a
little bit different same with the acls
and permissions the
when you design the pools go to storage
pools
and if we look at go here
edit acls this may seem a little bit
more complicated than the way you do
that over in synology with the file
station
and the way you do the permissions so
there's like i said
if you figure it out it seems easy but
if their first timer yes analogy might
be a little bit
easier at least one to give them a fair
shake on that
so i don't know if this really helps you
in which one to choose but i've now
laid out a few of these use cases like i
said we deployed both
the nice thing that amazes me about the
true nas is
you can download for free something that
i've
deployed and set up in large scale
enterprise environments on
rack servers that cost 50 plus thousand
dollars
and that's your still your systems right
here the same software
that scalable now synology we've played
with some of the larger synologies we've
never deployed them
our use cases mostly been targeted these
small businesses and small offices
and especially love the surveillance
station so hopefully this kind of gives
you some ideas of which one to get
i think the trunas line being fully open
source fits well with my open source
enthusiasm
and of course my love to tinker with
things because i can just create all the
jails i want and very
custom create all kinds of different
software on there uh set this up as
different targets for things
versus the uh synology for small
business going you know what i just need
something simple turnkey i need some
backups
i'd like it to run a couple of cameras
in my office and some files
can you do that yes analogies kind of
turn key for that makes it really simple
so if you're the more enthusiast type
and love all the knobs being available
to you to twist and turn and
really customize with a very flexible
and big community support
free nas if you're going i just want
turnkey and i like that
uh ui that kind of feels like a desktop
interface synology's got you covered
there and
you know the surveillance station grant
it does take licenses but hey that's
kind of a cool feature
along with some basic file permissions
for some sharing and maybe you want to
replicate this to another synology or
use that active backup or
you want to back up your office 365 and
g suite i've done a video on that and
that's a cool feature that comes with a
lot of these models of synology
you're kind of locked into way they
design things but they
do a reliable job but i will mention
that like hardware wise if you build it
yourself
synology kind of gets ruled out so if
you are a tanker or a home lab you want
to really dive deep into it the nuts and
bolts building it
well then you're going to go back over
to your freenas again and go i want to
build it myself with the freenash
truenas line
fully open source because i like to
customize everything i don't want
something talking to some proprietary
servers i'm going to lock it down and do
that
you can do that there's no license or
activation on these servers at all
uh some of this analogy software just
requires levels of activation to get it
set up
um not that that's the same as a license
but that's the way they you know have
control over it so
just some thoughts and throwing them out
there on you know final thoughts on this
but they're both good products they're
both very reliable that much i will save
for them
and whichever one you choose i think
you'll be happy with it just you know
look at the choices look at the options
and decide which one works for you
